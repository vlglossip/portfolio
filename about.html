                  <!--Victoria is certified in both computer programming and web development. Driven by a lifelong passion for coding and a commitment to inspiring others, she founded the Bit by Bit Coding Club at her former middle school and launched the HHS WiSTEM Chapter at her current high school. Victoria's local successes propelled her to expand her initiative globally through the non-profit, CODEify, where she  serves as Director of Outreach.  As a part of WiSTEM’s global leadership team serving as Front-End Website Manager, she aims to promote women in STEM by ensuring the organization's website effectively communicates its values and goals. Currently interning at Farragut Systems, she collaborates on designing applications for real estate valuation using statistical regression analysis. In her leisure time, Victoria is a swim instructor at Granite Falls and competes nationally in AKC trick dog competitions with her dogs Bijou and Holly.

                  Victoria doesn’t just code, she builds opportunity. Certified in Computer Programming and Web Development through Wake Tech, she founded Bit by Bit Coding to break barriers in tech education, delivering project-based programs to underserved students across 46 countries. Locally, she reignited computer science education at her former middle school and launched the WiSTEM Chapter at Heritage High School to empower young women in STEM. As Executive Director of Strategy at CODEify, she helped increase student enrollment globally by 203.85%, leading hackathons and expanding access to free tech education. At Farragut Systems, Victoria is the youngest Junior Developer, where she’s shaping ethical AI practices and building real-world Python applications to modernize industries. She authored A Girl’s Blueprint to Building Websites: Bit by Bit Book #1 to reach new learners worldwide and launched a YouTube channel to make coding accessible to anyone, anywhere.-->
                  As the Founder of Bit by Bit Coding and the executive director of strategy at CODEify, I’ve launched global platforms, mentored diverse students, and hosted hackathons that open doors to opportunities that others might not have had otherwise. I have dedicated over 610 hours of service to empowering underserved youth through computer science.  Whether I am giving a presentation on ethical ai use at Farragut, competing at regionals with HHS Varsity Swim Team or collaborating with colleagues over an automated valuation model we created at Farragut, I always lead with vision, integrity, and most importantly, heart.
