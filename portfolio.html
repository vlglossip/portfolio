               <h2>Resume</h2>
               <!--<p>This website is a prototype for an online resume, showcasing what I've learned, my experience, and other projects I've completed. The page that's linked is the actual resume page, but the entire website consists of a portfolio page with sections for work, school, and personal projects. There's a page dedicated to volunteer work I've done, sectioned off for each company I've worked with: CODEify, WiSTEM, and the Bit by Bit Coding Club. There's also a home, about, and contact page.</p>-->

               <p>This website began as a class project and has since evolved into a comprehensive online portfolio that showcases my professional journey and educational contributions. It highlights my work experience, volunteer service, and educational background, along with direct access to my YouTube channel, my first book A Girl's Blueprint to Building Websites, and my Amazon author page. Serving as both a resource and a resume, the site embodies my commitment to empowering others in tech and education.</p>
