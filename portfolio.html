               <h2>Resume</h2>
               <!--<p>This website is a prototype for an online resume, showcasing what I've learned, my experience, and other projects I've completed. The page that's linked is the actual resume page, but the entire website consists of a portfolio page with sections for work, school, and personal projects. There's a page dedicated to volunteer work I've done, sectioned off for each company I've worked with: CODEify, WiSTEM, and the Bit by Bit Coding Club. There's also a home, about, and contact page.</p>-->

               <p>This site is more than a portfolio- it’s the story of a grassroots effort that became a movement. It highlights my volunteer service, educational initiatives, and work experience, all rooted in a relentless commitment to expanding opportunity through technology. Here, you’ll find direct access to my book, A Girl’s Blueprint to Building Websites: Bit by Bit Book #1, my Amazon author page, the Bit by Bit Coding website, the Bit by Bit Coding Facebook Page, and my YouTube channel. You’ll also see the growth of Bit by Bit Coding, the nonprofit I founded to bridge digital divides, and our Facebook community, which I launched and scaled to over 300,000 users. More than a resume, this is a living record of how I build: with heart, with code, and with courage. It’s a testament to the belief that leadership is service, character is action, and access, like change, is built bit by bit.</p>

               <h2>Sprout & Grow</h2>
               <p>Sprout & Grow is a dynamic, user-centered website I designed for a fictional plant nursery based in North Carolina. The site serves as an interactive platform that blends commerce with education, offering a detailed plant catalog, promotional deals, and valuable resources for organic gardening enthusiasts. In addition to showcasing plant varieties, the website promotes community and educational events, enabling visitors to sign up for workshops and classes focused on sustainable gardening practices. Through this project, I highlighted my skills in web design, user experience, and content management while fostering a deeper connection between the nursery and its local community.</p>

               <h2>Meal Planner</h2>
               <p>Meal Planner is a user-friendly website designed to help individuals plan their meals for the week, promoting healthy eating habits and lifestyle. The site provides sections for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and two snacks, offering pre-written meal suggestions for those looking to lose weight or maintain a healthy diet. For more experienced users, there’s an option to clear all the pre-written content and input personalized meals. Once the user finalizes their meal plan, the site prompts them to input personal information, which is included in the printable output generated upon submission. This project showcases my ability to design practical, interactive websites that cater to specific user needs, ensuring both functionality and a seamless user experience.</p>
